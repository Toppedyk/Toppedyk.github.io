Hello There! 

My name is Taylor Oppedyk.I am studying to be a full stack developer and am currently learning MVC design and structure. 
I have a passion for problem solving so JavaScript and the logic puzzles it presents is my favorite to work with.
After attening The College of Idaho and earning a bachelors degree with a major and three minors, 
I worked in the manufacturing industry for two years. 
Making the switch to software development made me nervous, but I have discovered a passion in this and am extremely excited to build a career around it.
